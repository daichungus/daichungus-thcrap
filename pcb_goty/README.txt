===What is it ?===
Paint Cherry Blossom is Team Mountain of Fail's 7th shooting game made entirely with the paint engine, a next gen engine with 4k graphics.
It's a troll patch so don't take it too seriously

===Story===
One day in Gensokyo everything became paint-like, our favourite characters looks like shit for no reasons that's why Reimu, Marisa
and Sakuya are investigating to find the culprit. Will Gensokyo become normal again ? Will you survive with those ugly graphics ?
Will you clear the game ? Anly YOU can answer those questions !!!

===How to install ?==
Replace your original "th07e.dat" or "th07.dat" by the one contained in the.zip (Don't forget to backup your original .dat)

===Credits===
This patch was made by Gastari but I was helped by a lot of people :
